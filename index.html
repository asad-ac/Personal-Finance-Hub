                <h4> What is a credit limit? </h4>
                <p> A credit limit is the amount you are able to spend using that line of credit. If you have multiple credit cards, the credit limit are cumulative. For example, if I had two credit cards, and one of them had a Credit Limit of 5000 and the other had a limit of 1000. This means I have a total of 6000, which is what is checked when people are worried about keeping there credit utilization, The total credit limit of all lines. Though, credit utilization is not something that should be worried about unless you're applying for a mortgage. Just pay your statement balance in full by the date. </p>

                <h3> Myth vs Fact </h3>
                <p> Myth: Keep Your Credit Utilization under 30% </p>
                <h5> Myth: Credit cards are bad </h5>
                <p> Fact: Credit cards are a great way to establish history of being reliable to others especially when applying for things like a mortgage, or a auto loan. Having an established history will allow you to get better rates </p>
                <p> Myth: Pay off your balance right away </p>
                <p> Fact: Pay your statement balance in full by the due date. This allows the amount you owed to be posted to Credit Bureaus so they can see the amount you payed. If you pay off right away they never see anything. This is important because waiting maximizes your score! Not every time you use a credit card is due, in the very next due date. You're only responsibility is the statement balance. All others will get pushed onto the following due date. I really hope that makes sense. </p>

                <h3> Choosing The Right Credit Card </h3>
                <p> I wanted to go over this since, many people when they first become eligible (18+) first line of credit ends up being a credit card.</p>
                <p> As a noob (18) Unless you're an authorized user you're probably not going to be able to get those gold cards or those super high tier cards right away. You have to start from the ground up, unless you're an authorized user but even then it's not under your name. So to best build habits and keeping your money in check, I reccomend the most common cards tend to be Discover Student card or Capital one's Student card which will have extremely low credit limits to start but once you start paying the statement balance in full by the due date. The bank will see that and they will raise your Credit Limit typically every 6 months automatically. Though you can also request an limit, and potentially how much and that will be up to the bank to decide given your financial history and income.</p>

FYI: In your banking app or services such as Credit Karma tend to only show one of the bureaus above on the platform. Lots of different types of Fico's but most important is FICO8 from Experian. VantageScore isn't commonly used by lenders and is the one that is usually posted.</p>
